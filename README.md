# Country Quiz 

A JavaFX quiz which tests your knowledge of the world's countries. 

If the "correct" country was entered but spelled incorrectly, the SP button can be pressed to update the most previous entry. Different "Regions" are included so all the countries are viewable, these typically represent the continents. The History button can be pressed to view all of the results so far, including the total number correct.

Note that it is possible to get the same country multiple times, as a random one is chosen every time with replacement.

A video of the program running can be seen in the demos directory.
